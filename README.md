# My emotion profile in 2019

At the end of 2018, while surfing 9gag, I saw a guy sharing his mood records over the year. "Wow, that's so cool" was what I thought. Thus, I decided that this year I would do the same, i.e. recording my emotions, mood, and thinking over the year and do some visualization of it at the end. This is also the first "fun" data science project of mine, so the pros out there, please don't laugh :)

To record the data, I used the mobile app [pixel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.teovogel.yip&hl=en_SG). With this app, each day you can rate your mood, from 1 to 5, indicate your emotions, such as "happiness", "motivation", etc., and write a short notes, like a 1-sentence diary. The data can be exported to json format for analysis. The analysis can be found [HERE](https://github.com/dmnguyen92/My-emotion-profile-in-2019/blob/master/my_mood_2019.ipynb)
